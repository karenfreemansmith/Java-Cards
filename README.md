# Java Card Deck
Version 0.0.0: February 15, 2018 by [Karen Freeman-Smith](https://github.com/karenfreemansmith)

Please write a set of classes that represent a deck of cards.

Classes like “card” and “deck” might be appropriate - but it’s entirely up to you.  You should be able to “shuffle” the deck.  You should also be able to draw cards from the deck one at a time until the deck is empty.  Include tests.

Please track changes in Git and submit your code as a GitHub repository we can view.

This task shouldn't take more than two hours to complete and can be completed and returned as your schedule allows.
